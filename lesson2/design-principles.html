                    <p>Apple's mobile website exemplifies the design principle of Contrast in several ways. Firstly, the use of contrasting colors is evident throughout the page, with the white text on a black background providing a clear and legible contrast. Additionally, the use of large, bold headings and smaller body text further emphasizes the contrast between the two. Finally, the use of high-quality product images with a white background serves to further highlight the contrast between the product and its surroundings, making it more visually appealing and easier to focus on.</p>

                    <img src="images/spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify">
                    <p>Spotify's mobile website exemplifies the design principle of Repetition in several ways. Firstly, the use of consistent typography and color scheme throughout the page creates a sense of cohesion and familiarity. The green color used in the logo and throughout the page is repeated in various elements such as buttons, icons, and links. Secondly, the use of repeating patterns in the background further reinforces the design principle of repetition and creates a visually interesting texture. Finally, the use of a consistent layout for each section of the page, with repeating elements such as headings, subheadings, and icons, helps users quickly understand the structure of the page and find what they are looking for.</p>

                    <p>Airbnb's mobile website exemplifies the design principle of Alignment in several ways. Firstly, the use of a grid system is evident throughout the page, with each element aligned to create a sense of order and structure. This is particularly evident in the search bar and navigation menu, which are perfectly centered and aligned with each other. Additionally, the use of white space between elements serves to further emphasize their alignment and create a sense of balance. Finally, the use of consistent typography and spacing between elements further reinforces the alignment of the page, making it easy to navigate and visually appealing.</p>
