      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>The Manama Chamber of Commerce page is for a small District (smaller than a town) called Manama, in the sourthen part of Zimbabwe, in a town called Gwanda. It should also be able to reach out to various members of the community and investors.</p>
      <p>There are small businesses in the area which include, but not limited to, cattle, goat, sheep and donkey breeders. There are people who do vegetable production as well as iron-smiths, who produce mainly scortch-carts, wheel-barrows, dor-frames and window-frames. These businesses are likely to be interested in networking with other companies in the region. The chamber of commerce can provide them with the necessary resources and support to succeed. This can be done through the  establishment of programs and initiatives that help entrepreneurs and businesses grow.</p> 
      <p>Secondly, entrepreneurs who are interested in starting a business in the area would be another key target audience.  The chamber of commerce could provide information and resources to help these individuals get started, such as business planning guides, market research data, and mentorship programs.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, investors who are interested in the local economy could also be a target audience.  The chamber of commerce could provide information about investment opportunities in the area, such as real estate development, tourism ventures, or local product exports.  This could also include data about the local workforce, tax incentives, and government policies.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, tourists who are interested in learning more about the local culture and economy could also be a key audience.  The chamber of commerce could provide information about local attractions, events, and businesses that are of interest to visitors.  This could include information about local crafts, food, and cultural practices.</p> 
      <!-- <p>Fifthly, government officials who are interested in supporting economic development in the area could also be a target audience.  The chamber of commerce could work closely with local and national government officials to advocate for policies and programs that support economic growth in the region.  Finally, community members who live in the area would also be an important audience.</p> -->
      <p>The goal of a chamber of commerce is to provide its members with the necessary resources and support to succeed. This can be done through the establishment of a variety of programs and initiatives that help entrepreneurs and businesses grow.</p>
